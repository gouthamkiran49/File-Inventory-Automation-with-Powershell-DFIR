# File-Inventory-Automation-with-Powershell-DFIR
This project shows how PowerShell can be used to analyze Windows file systems by extracting file metadata and SHA-256 hash values from NTFS. Using small, focused scripts, it demonstrates how file names, extensions, and timestamps can be collected in a clear and repeatable way, reflecting real-world file auditing and forensic analysis workflows.
